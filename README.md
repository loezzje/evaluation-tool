# evaluation-tool

Practise full stack javascript/React/Feathers API - work in progress

The goal of the app is to be able to evaluate students assigned to a class (batch). Based on their latest evaluation, the app will be able to generate a student to ask a question to semi-randomly. 

The practise goal is to put an algorythm into syntax and use it in a full stack app. 


### Steps to take:
 
* fix authorization
* Edit, create and delete students
* optional: move algorythm to backend, or make it part of an onClick event
